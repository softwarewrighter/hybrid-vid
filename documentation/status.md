# Status: Hybrid-VID

## Current
- Repository initialized with documentation: architecture, PRD, design, plan, status.
- Multi-workspace Rust (edition 2024) scaffold with processing libs, CLIs, and Yew web UI.
- Imported `Claude.md` from both symlinked repos into `documentation/sources/`.
- Generated `process.md`, `tools.md`, and `ai_agent_instructions.md` via `proact`; placed at `documentation/` (canonical location).

## Recent Changes
- Added initial design and planning documents.

## Open Items
- Confirm integration points with `video-publishing` and `yt-rs` symlinks.
- Define JSON schemas for project and steps.
- Import `process.md` and `tools.md` if/when present.
 - Decide whether to keep or remove `hybrid-vid/COPYRIGHT` and `hybrid-vid/LICENSE` files generated by `proact`.

## Risks
- Integration complexity; ensure stable adapter boundaries.
- Publishing/auth configuration across environments.

## Next Steps
- Create `hybrid-vid/cli` with `init`, `status` stubs.
- Add `hybrid-vid/template` with directory + metadata skeleton.
- Draft step graph for MVP pipeline.
