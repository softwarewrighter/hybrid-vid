# Source Documents (to Reuse)

The following documents from symlinked repositories should inform processes and tooling here. Per request, do not modify those repositories; copy relevant guidance into this repo as needed.

- `video-publishing/process.md`
- `video-publishing/Claude.md`
- `video-publishing/tools.md`
- `yt-rs/process.md` (if present)
- `yt-rs/Claude.md` (if present)
- `yt-rs/tools.md` (if present)

Imported so far:
- `documentation/sources/video-publishing/Claude.md`
- `documentation/sources/yt-rs/Claude.md`
- `documentation/process.md`
- `documentation/tools.md`
- `documentation/ai_agent_instructions.md`

Pending (not found or not yet imported):
- `process.md`, `tools.md` in each symlinked repo (if they exist)

Next step: align our `plan.md` and CLI help with these sources and copy additional files as they become available.
